As the birth of A.J.'s daughter approached, the Bristol 7's knew that they had to record an album. Otherwise... well, I guess there really isn't an otherwise. They just knew they had to record an album because it would be a TOTALLY BOSS thing to do.

Hence, over the course of a couple months, the Narwhalingus EP was created. We loved making this music, and hopefully you'll love listening to it. But if not, we're really not all that bothered by it, because we made it for us. But seriously, enjoy!
